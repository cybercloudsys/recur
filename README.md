You can easily use it to create simple or complex patterns for events that repeat at regular intervals, including events that occur on custom days or months. You can also customize the weekly off days to be used in the pattern, and generate a human-readable text representation of the pattern.\
It gives easy way to check if a given time matches a specific pattern, and calculate the next time that a pattern will occur.\
